This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To start the project

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

To add default populations to localStorage of "Students" and "Classes", I added values to a json file.
Quick styling was done with `semantic-ui-react` and basic styling in the css file. Styling was not of the high importance for my project.
Most of the work was done battling localStorage for it acting like a database so some issues that were left would easily be disappeared with a real database,
such as when removing a class, also remove it from the student and having Student's classes storage as an ID instead of the class itself as a string.




To Run tests

```
yarn test
```
